# Global Happiness Index Indicators 2021

This is an analysis seeking to determine the factors that are the strongest indicators of whether a country's happiness index is high or low.

The data consists of two separate datasets. The first contains crime statistics such as crime rate, weapon density, etc by country. The second contains measures such as happiness index, economic data, and social perceptions. More information can be found in the Jupyter Notebook associated with this project. The raw data is also available in this project's repository.

There is an associated interactive Tableau story available. It is linked at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook associated with this project.
